{"files":{"fileList":{"filename":"Safeguards\/Messages\/V3.4\/README.md","contents":"# Service Usage\nThis service (known as SV081) is used to match client and application information data against a set of pre-defined risk profiles. Safeguards will extract the request data into individual characterisitcs which are then matched against a set of pre-defined risk profiles. If there is a profile match (ie. the data characterisitcs are present in the request message) Safeguards will return a match indicator, as well as treatment information on the risk."}}}
